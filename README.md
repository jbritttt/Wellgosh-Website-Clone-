# Wellgosh-Website-Clone !!! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!

Clone im currently building of the home page from a website called (Wellgosh) using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

Slick carousel slider has been added and customised. Mobile version starting from 320px is nearly complete apart from a few transition affects needing added.
I will then style the layout from 320px up to desktop. And last of all I will create the navigation modal and hamburger modal (javascript) 

I usually dont format the code until im finished working with it, as I find it easier to scan through.
You can checkout the original wellgosh website at https://wellgosh.com/ if you would like to compare it with my work to date.
