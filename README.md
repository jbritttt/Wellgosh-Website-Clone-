# Wellgosh-Website-Clone

Clone im currently building of the home page from a website called (Wellgosh) using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

Slick carousel slider has been added and customised. Layout/styling complete and fully responsive. W3C validation complete on HTML and CSS (no errors or warnngs)
Next I will finish navigation modal on hover, create a drop down modal for search functionality and hamburger modal (javascript) Then set the images up so that they lazy load with slick slider. I also need to double check HTML semantics and add images in the format of WEBP


You can checkout the original wellgosh website at https://wellgosh.com/ if you would like to compare it with my work to date.
